Diagnostic comparison of monthly/proxy accounting versus broker-ledger account replay.

Important: target-book forward returns are used only for attribution. They are not production signals.

## Readout

- If broker daily MaxDD is much worse than legacy/proxy MaxDD, monthly accounting was hiding intramonth losses.
- If target turnover and fees are high, the strategy must be redesigned around account-aware holding, staging, and replacement rules.
- A proxy target pass is not promotion evidence until the broker-ledger path also passes.
